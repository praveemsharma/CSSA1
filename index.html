    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements. </li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section. </li>
            <li >External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
            </li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the style in external CSS file.
                However,<mark>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal style</mark> , beacuse this is easier to demonstrate,
                and easier for you to try if yourdelf.

        <div>
            <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID , thedifference is that CSS class applies a style to
                multiple element ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element
                , ID is also special in that you can a special URL to link directly to an
                element and its used by javascript.
            </p>
            <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific elenent or range of ekements on a web page. Once am
                element has beeen rargered,a style or ser of style can be applied to the elemenr.</p>
            <p>There is a wide range of selecrots available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used
                to targer elements to ehich a style should be appplied.</p>
